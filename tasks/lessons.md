- When the user asks to use multiple sub-agents, start parallel sub-agent execution immediately for independent workstreams (analysis + implementation) instead of doing sequential local-only work.
- For sandbox-sensitive test work, assign one sub-agent to implementation and one to coverage-gap analysis, then integrate both outcomes in the main branch.
