# Known-good SHA-256 hashes — subtract from IOC lists to reduce false positives.
# Format: one SHA-256 hash per line.
# Sources: top Linux packages from Debian/Ubuntu official repositories.
#
# To regenerate: download .deb packages from official mirrors and compute
# sha256sum on the contained binaries.

# --- Core system binaries (coreutils, util-linux, etc.) ---
# These are placeholders — replace with actual hashes from your target distro.
# Run: dpkg -L coreutils | xargs -I{} sha256sum {} 2>/dev/null
#
# --- Common libraries (glibc, openssl, zlib, etc.) ---
# Run: dpkg -L libc6 | xargs -I{} sha256sum {} 2>/dev/null
#
# --- Package managers ---
# Run: dpkg -L apt | xargs -I{} sha256sum {} 2>/dev/null
#
# --- Python runtime ---
# Run: dpkg -L python3 | xargs -I{} sha256sum {} 2>/dev/null
#
# --- Shells ---
# Run: dpkg -L bash | xargs -I{} sha256sum {} 2>/dev/null

# NOTE: This file should be populated with actual hashes from your environment.
# The CI pipeline will subtract any IOC hash that appears here.
# Add hashes of known-good binaries that are commonly flagged as false positives.
